        Hi, I'm Athena (Xiaohe) Liu! I'm a <strong>PhD candidate in applied science </strong> and an amateur <strong>data scientist / machine learning engineer</strong> based in Vancouver, Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working towards my doctorial degree{" "}

        in Fluid Dynamics in the{" "}
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={links.ubcfluid}>
          University of British Columbia
        </a>
        . My research tries to understand the physics of high
        speed liquid jet impingement, using a mixed approach of computational simulation, theoretical modeling and experimental method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from my studies in fluids, I also enjoy working with data - from visualizing experimental data to training deep learning algorithms for generating predictions. Since 2018, I have been working as teaching assistant for "MECH305: Data Analysis and Statistics" at UBC, creating and teaching tutorials for 3rd year undergrads on the subject of statistics and machine learning with MATLAB and python.

        In my free time, I enjoy cuddling with my cats{" "}
